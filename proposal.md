Title: tetris-screensaver

Repository: https://github.com/JesseChapman/tetris-screensaver.git

Description: A tetris screensaver that is a loop and will have the different shapes and colored blocks falling into rows. When a row is filled all the way it will disappear and the remaining will fall down to the bottom like in the game of tetris.

Features:
    -blocks will fall and rotate to fit open spaces
    -when a row is filled the rows will disappear and the remaining will fall down
    -the screensaver will be a loop that repeats

Challenges:
    -figure out how to make the blocks rotate into position
    -figure out how to make the completed rows dissapear and fall down
    -make sure the loop repeats with no noticable gaps

Outcomes:

    a.Ideal Outcome- The screensaver functions properly and completes the loop repeating.

    b.Minimal Viable Outcome- The blocks fall into place and delete the completed rows. The blocks won't rotate or loop completely.

Milestones:
    1st Week. Get the blocks to fall and rotate into place
    2nd Week. Get the completed rows to disappear and fall to the bottom
    3rd Week. Get the screensaver to loop back to the beginning seamlessly
